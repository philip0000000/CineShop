# CineShop

CineShop is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application developed as a group project during the Lexicon .NET training program (2025).  
It was built based on the "Movie Shop" assignment, focusing on database-driven web development using C#, Entity Framework Core, and MVC structure.

I contributed to this project as part of a development team.
